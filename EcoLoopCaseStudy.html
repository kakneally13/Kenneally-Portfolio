            <p class="EcoSub"><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
            <p class="EcoBodyCenter">The global climate crisis continues to pose a threat to the future of humanity, with the United States being one of the top contributors to the problem. Although people recognize there is a problem, and seemingly want to help, it is difficult to motivate change as they feel the problem is too far gone, and that they alone cannot make an impact. How can we help motivate people to act more sustainably in their everyday life?<p>

            <p class="EcoSub"><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
            <p class="EcoBodyCenter">An app that make sustainability fun and approachable through positive UX writing and gamification. Shifting the problem from the whole world to the individual.</p>

              <p class="EcoBodyBold"><strong>Choosing a Topic:</strong></p> 
              <p class="EcoBody">We were challenged with the task of developing an app to solve for a local or global problem. As a group we knew we wanted to do something on the topic of sustainability, as it was something we all individually felt passionate about and is an important topic globally. However, with sustainability being such a broad category with a wide potential user base, we were challenged to keep a focused scope. We initially chose not to narrow our scope but to let our initial research guide us to a more concrete problem. </p>
              <p class="EcoBodyBold"><strong>Our Assumptions:</strong></p>
              <p class="EcoBody">Before conducting any research we created a proto persona. Our main assumption was that anyone who would use our app already had a desire to be more sustainable or continue to live sustainably. We did not want to focus on converting people to be more sustainable. Based on this we placed our proto persona in the 25-40 age range, as we felt people in this age group typically believe in the climate crisis and are more willing to do something about it. Based on our own internal biases we assumed that some barriers to sustainability would be budget and the general knowledge around how to be more sustainable. This lead us to believe that our target user would be someone in a mid-low income household, who is just doing the little things they can to be more sustainable.</p>

                <p class="EcoBody">We decided that because we were limited on time and there is already a lot of quantitative data available on the topic of sustainability, we would focus our research efforts on user interviews, instead of a survey. Through our user interviews our goal was to gain insight into users' personal experiences and beliefs on sustainability. </p>

                <ol>

                    <p class="EcoBody">We wanted to understand people's current attitudes towards sustainability so we would have a baseline to move forward from. As a group we discovered that we all personally had different views on what being sustainable meant to us, and we assumed that many of our users would also have different understandings of this.  We asked questions like: “What is your current relationship with sustainability?”, “What does "living sustainable" look like to you?”, and “Tell me about the last time you heard about someone talking about sustainability. What was your reaction?”</p>
                    <li class="EcoBodyBold"><strong>Understand users' pain points on living a more sustainable lifestyle/Understand why people may not live as sustainably as they would like</strong></li>
                    <p class="EcoBody">After we had our baseline of what sustainability meant to our user, our next focus was to figure out what is stopping them from achieving their sustainable goals. We thought if we could figure out why people weren't meeting their goals we could come up with more targeted solutions to help them do so.</p>
                    <li class="EcoBodyBold"><strong>Understand how people make decisions on sustainability</strong></li>
                    <p class="EcoBody">Finally we wanted to discover what currently motivates people to make more sustainable decisions, to see if there was anything that was currently working for our user that we could expand upon.</p>

                <p class="EcoBody">Through our interviews we found that money was not one of the greatest barriers to sustainability, as we had expected. A lot of people did say that money played a role in making sustainable decisions and purchases, however the key barrier they were facing was an emotional one. All of our interviewees expressed that even though they recognize that sustainability is important and that they want to do better for the future, they felt it was a hopeless cause and just to big of a problem for them to solve, so why even bother?</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">After conducting our interviews we created an empathy map and user pesona to help us consolidate our learnings into one key user for our app. Since emotions played such a big role in our interviews we wanted to focus on what our user “Says/Does” versus what they “Think/Feel.”</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">Overall, we found that our user felt overwhelmed by how big and existential the problem was, and that they alone could not solve it. As a group we discussed the issues of accountability and how people expressed that they often look to others to guide them on what they should be doing - if they felt others were not pulling their weight, they could slack off as well. A lot of people felt guilty for not doing enough to be more sustainable. Even though a lot of users feared the problem was too far gone, all were still hopeful that someday, someone would find a solution.</p>

Discussing our ideas together also allowed us to come up with new ideas and bounce off of each other. </p>
                <p class="EcoBody">Since the problem we were facing was so vast we wanted to separate our problem statement into three parts: User Mentality, Global Impact and Potential Solution.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">We knew that we wanted to have the main focus of our project be on changing the user mentality when it comes to being more sustainable.

                <p class="EcoBody">In our initial brainstorm we used the “I like, I wish, I wonder” method to get out any ideas we had for possible solutions to our problem statement. </p>
                <p class="EcoBody">We felt that our user would like to be reminded of their goals to help motivate them, and that they like the feeling of accomplishment when they do something they feel is sustainable. To do this, we wanted to have positive UX writing embedded throughout the app.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">We found that since this was such a daunting problem, users would find it easier if it was broken up into smaller tasks. In our interviews each user thought of a different part of their life when it came sustainability, so we wanted wanted to make sure each category of life could be represented. We came up with the categories of Home, Food, Clothes, Waste and Transportation. Each category would also have subcategories to further break down the problem.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">We also found that it would be very important to shift the focus from the fate of the world and what others are doing, to self reward and feeling good about what users personally are doing. We discussed the idea of having a personal ecosystem for each user and having a customizable avatar so the user could see themselves physically placed in their personal ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">We wanted to see if we could gamify sustainability to make it seem more lighthearted and enjoyable, while encouraging more and more growth. We decided on having a rewards system and having multiple ways to earn rewards so each user could find something that was gratifying.</p>

                <p class="EcoBody">We did multiple rounds of prototypes, iterations and user tests before landing on our current design. Initially we started with paper prototypes so we could figure out the general layout of things and what components we would need for our pages.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">I came up with the idea for the home page to be the avatar standing on top of the earth as a fun way to represent the user's personal ecosystem. This really set the tone for the playfulness of the app and allowed us to keep the focus on curating each users personal ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">Throughout the design process I found the rewards system to be the most difficult to create. I looked at many other apps to see how they were motivating users to keep playing. I really liked the visual appeal of the Apple Watch's Fitness App and the satisfaction users got when closing each ring. In addition, I looked at Duolingo and Trivia Crack for their rewards systems and decided to create badges for the users to earn in addition to completing their daily goals. Finally, I wanted to create an opportunity to partner with sustainable brands to give our users the chance to earn real-life rewards. I thought these may be the most exciting rewards to our users, due to the fact that they would be monetarily based and we learned that our users often saw money as a barrier to sustainability. I wanted to make sure these rewards were the most challenging and required the user to enter the app more than once. The result was a weekly challenge where users could complete multiple tasks earning them points throughout the week, to ultimately earn a discount to a sustainable brand.</p>
                <p class="EcoBody">The biggest challenge we now faced was how to represent our rewards using our UI, so that they are easily understandable and exciting to our user.</p>
