                <p class="caseBody">There was a big learning curve to this project as we did not have access to stakeholders. This, paired with the very difficult navigation and organization of the site, made it very difficult to decipher what the goal/purpose of the site was. I started by creating a proto-persona and user scenario in hopes that this would help me better understand the intended user and what they might go to this site for. Initially because of the large “Love My Park Day” banner displayed on the homepage, I thought the site would be focused on volunteer opportunities and activism. However, through much investigation I discovered it was really geared towards education and information on regulations and policies. </p>
                <p class="caseBody">Though I think there really could be two separate user groups - everyday citizens and policy makers - I wanted to focus on making the site more accessible to everyday people. Even without speaking to stakeholders I could see efforts to do this already on the site by including the Twitter feed as well as some of the family-oriented imagery, but found the content to be very difficult to understand, leaving myself and other potential users extremely frustrated. Being that the site was so vast in information and possible user flows, I decided for this project to focus on revamping the homepage and main navigation as well as a path I thought my proto-persona would typically take.</p>

                <p class="caseBody">I wanted to test the initial site in order to see the pain points a user might have when trying to work through a typical flow. As suspected, there were many challenges, especially with the navigation. Each of my users found different ways to to complete the task and only one of them used what I had determined was the most direct path. Many wanted to go straight to the search function as they found the site was much too overwhelming. Overall the testers found that the site was very dense and text heavy. This was very much in line with what I found when completing my heuristic evaluation. The combined knowledge from user tests and heuristic evaluation validated that my focus/priority needed to be on the main navigation.</p>
