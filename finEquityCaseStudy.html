    <div class=" col-lg-7 col-sm-12">
        <h2 class="finequityFont">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="finequityBody">Families and individuals affected by incarceration often don't have foundational building blocks in place for financial success, such as checking accounts, healthy credit scores, credit cards, and retirement savings.</p>
        <p class="finequityBody">Without the foundational background, individuals are more prone to recidivism and repeating the cycle rather than breaking it. FinEQUITY aims to reduce these barriers and introduce users to these concepts through correspondence courses, micro-loans and online instruction—however, finEQUITY currently doesn't have the digital infrastructure to achieve this. </p>

        <h2 class="finequityFont">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="finequityBody">We created a responsive mobile design of the site that properly executes their shift in focus to a more user friendly site. We prototyped a cleaner, more streamlined website that draws attention to the services offered.

            <p class="finequityBody">For this project we were lucky enough to have a team member that was in contact with the company stakeholders. This was very helpful because we were able to gain better insight into what they were looking achieve with the site’s redesign, instead of making assumptions based on their current site. It gave us a great advantage in understanding a path forward for the site. It was very important to us to balance stakeholder needs with what we felt needed improvement for the user.</p>
            <p class="finequityBody">We had some difficult blockers to work through in terms of access to our user group (incarcerated persons). It was challenging to come up with creative and effective ways to gain secondary information that would help inform our persona. However, we did find some unique ways to try to mitigate this problem. We looked on chat forums for formerly incarcerated persons, to try to gain direct insight into our user and the challenges they face. We watched interviews on the subject that other people who had more access had done.</p>
            <p class="finequityBody">When choosing our interview candidates we carefully selected people who we felt may have similar challenges to formerly incarcerated persons who may face challenges such as low financial literacy.</p>
            <p class="finequityBody">We were able to leverage the knowledge from the stakeholders as well as some secondary research in order to make up for this gap in our primary research.</p>
