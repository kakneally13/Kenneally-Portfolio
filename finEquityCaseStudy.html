    <div class=" col-lg-7 col-sm-12">
        <h2 class="finequityFont">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="finequityBody">Families and individuals affected by incarceration often don't have foundational building blocks in place for financial success, such as checking accounts, healthy credit scores, credit cards, and retirement savings.</p>
        <p class="finequityBody">Without the foundational background, individuals are more prone to recidivism and repeating the cycle rather than breaking it. FinEQUITY aims to reduce these barriers and introduce users to these concepts through correspondence courses, micro-loans and online instruction—however, finEQUITY currently doesn't have the digital infrastructure to achieve this. </p>

        <h2 class="finequityFont">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="finequityBody">We created a responsive mobile design of the site that properly executes their shift in focus to a more user friendly site. We prototyped a cleaner, more streamlined website that draws attention to the services offered.

        <p class="finequityBody">For this project we were lucky enough to have a team member that was in contact with the company stakeholders. This was very helpful because we were able to gain better insight into what they were looking achieve with the site’s redesign, instead of making assumptions based on their current site. It gave us a great advantage in understanding a path forward for the site. It was very important to us to balance stakeholder needs with what we felt needed improvement for the user.</p>
        <p class="finequityBody">We had some difficult blockers to work through in terms of access to our user group (incarcerated persons). It was challenging to come up with creative and effective ways to gain secondary information that would help inform our persona. However, we did find some unique ways to try to mitigate this problem. We looked on chat forums for formerly incarcerated persons, to try to gain direct insight into our user and the challenges they face. We watched interviews on the subject that other people who had more access had done.</p>
        <p class="finequityBody">When choosing our interview candidates we carefully selected people who we felt may have similar challenges to formerly incarcerated persons who may face challenges such as low financial literacy.</p>
        <p class="finequityBody">We were able to leverage the knowledge from the stakeholders as well as some secondary research in order to make up for this gap in our primary research.</p>

    <p>Through our interviews and survey, we discovered that financial literacy has rarely been taught and most users piece together information on their own. We believe that having access to financial literacy tools and mentorship is essential. By changing the focus of the finEQUITY website towards immediately accessing resources and services, families of incarcerated people and those rehabilitating their finances after incarceration will be able to find assistance faster and more easily.</p>

Todd also has some emotional barriers that he is working through after constantly being told he will never amount to anything, and feeling stupid for not being able to figure this out on his own but also being embarrassed to ask for help. His record is something that he can't change and he knows it has a bad stigma surrounding it. He has realized that when people find out about his record he is treated differently and finds it very discouraging when applying for jobs. </p>

          <p class="finequityBody">When making our user flow we wanted to map out all the possible options a person could have upon entering the site. We found that there were three major categories for those who would find themselves on finEquity: those who were in need of services, those who wanted to help through volunteering or donations, and potential business investors. Because the stakeholders had expressed that they weren't currently needing the website to service potential investors as much as they may have in the past, we felt it was best to focus on what would benefit those in need of the site's services. </p>
          <p class="finequityBody">Our journey map takes us through our user persona, Todd's, experience. This starts when his sister first finds out about finEquity while looking for ways to help her brother while he is incarcerated. It takes us through the user flow they would discover using the site, as well as the potential benefits and lasting impacts it can have on Todd's life. We found this journey to be incredibly compelling and motivating. It helped us to empathize with our user, making our design that much more purposeful.</p>

                <p class="finequityBody">When designing our wireframes we took a mobile-first approach. We looked at apps from many different non-profits for our main inspiration. Specifically, we wanted to make an impactful homepage, find a more effective and less confusing way to outline our services page, and create a compelling donation page that would inspire new donations. </p>
                <p class="finequityBody">We went through a process of paper-prototyping to gather our collective ideas. We found this to be beneficial because we could individually get our ideas out quickly, and then as a team review and see where we had similar ideas. We saw that in many situations we were aligned but in some, such as the services page, we wanted to do some A/B testing in our low fidelity wireframes.  </p>
                <p class="finequityBody">We were concerned that displaying the services was going to be too much reading and a lot of scrolling, but through testing discovered our user liked to have all the information out in front of them and that overall it told a more impactful story.</p>
                <p class="finequityBody">After our first round of paper-prototypes were settled, we moved on to mid-fi wireframes and user testing. </p>

        <h1 class="finequityFontBig">User Test Results</h1>
        <p class="finequityBody">There was a lot of mixed feedback from our first round of user testing.  Although a lot of it was very positive, saying the site was very easy to use (SUS Score of 83.75), we still had a couple of users who struggled to complete the first task: applying for a service. </p>
        <p class="finequityBody">The process was not as intuitive as we had expected. People could only find the services in our hamburger menu, which we intentionally didn’t make clickable because we wanted to see how they would do with navigating the homepage. Users either didn’t scroll down far enough to see that there was a button, or didn’t connect that they could access a separate services page.  We thought that perhaps this was because we separated each service into a card. This  meant we didn’t have enough space to outline what each service was and our buttons were falling below the fold. In order to fix this in our high fidelity design we took a more direct approach, making one button to “explore services”.
