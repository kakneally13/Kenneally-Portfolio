They are skeptical that their current resources are not trustworthy and don't have their best interest at heart. We have observed that users prioritize and trust the guidance of friends and other experienced travelers when planning a trip. How might we design an informative product that travelers can use to leverage their social network to support travel decisions and to plan an exciting trip.</p>

I pulled a lot of inspiration from my user POV statements (formed after my initial research) and my user insight statements (made in the define phase). The goal was to constantly refer back to the user research, to come up with ideas that would help solve for pain points. Ideation focused on how to bring joy back into the planning process. </p>
                  <p class="AWGbody">For this phase I wanted the input of as many people as possible, to generate many ideas; I asked for ideas from family, friends, colleagues and classmates to try and leave no stone unturned. This was very effective because the more ideas others gave me the more I was able to come up with myself. Using the Moscow Method I was able to take all our ideas and determine which ideas would be most impactful and able to be effected in the short timeframe.</p>

One was to do a competitive analysis to understand what was currently out there in the market. I discovered that,  although some similar apps to what I wanted to achieve existed, none covered both the social aspect, as well as planning functionality I had prioritized .They had many strengths as well as weaknesses for me to learn from in terms of usability and aesthetics.</p>
                  <p class="AWGbody">I also wanted to create a clear user flow before sketching out my ideas into wireframes. I found it helpful to use paper prototypes to work out my ideas quickly to see in more detail anything I may have been missing in my user flow so I could make further iterations before going into Mid-fi.</p>

                  <p class="AWGbody">I decided to use iOS guidelines for style elements in order to streamline the design and make it more intuitive to users who are familiar with other iOS apps.</p>
                  <p class="AWGbody">In my mid-fi prototypes I tried to use minimal color, so it wouldn’t be distracting to user testers. I wanted users to be able to focus on the user flow so I could receive feedback on the usability, rather then the color scheme. I used shades of grey and did only used blue in key iOS modals for a cohesive look. </p>
