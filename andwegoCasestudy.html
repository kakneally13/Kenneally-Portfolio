I pulled a lot of inspiration from my user POV statements (formed after my initial research) and my user insight statements (made in the define phase). The goal was to constantly refer back to the user research, to come up with ideas that would help solve for pain points. Ideation focused on how to bring joy back into the planning process. </p>
                      <p class="AWGbody">For this phase I wanted the input of as many people as possible, to generate many ideas; I asked for ideas from family, friends, colleagues and classmates to try and leave no stone unturned. This was very effective because the more ideas others gave me the more I was able to come up with myself. Using the Moscow Method I was able to take all our ideas and determine which ideas would be most impactful and able to be effected in the short timeframe.</p>

This helped me be able to empathize  and  reflect on if my features were still on target for my goal. It also helped me explain to others the big picture idea for my app without having to go into too many details.</p>
